DO IT! CHALLENGE - 8.2 Greedy Algorithm

You only have a certain amount of time to meet with your friends. Use a greedy algorithm to determine
the best way to schedule your meetings. You want to meet with as many people as possible. You are
given an array of people with the times they can start and end their meetings with you. Return an
optimal schedule for meetings. This is similar to the classroom scheduling problem from the beginning
of Unit 8, module 1.
