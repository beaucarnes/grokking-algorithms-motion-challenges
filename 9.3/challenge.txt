DO IT! CHALLENGE - 9.3 Dynamic Programming

You have some time off work and you want to spend time vising friends. You don't have enough time to
visit all the friends you want to visit. Given how much time it takes to visit each friend and how
much you want to visit each friend (the value), write an algorithm to determine the maximum value you
can get from visiting friends in the amount of time that is passed in. This is very similar to the
knapsack problem from the video. Instead of weight you have time and instead of price you have value.
