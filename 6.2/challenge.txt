DO IT! CHALLENGE - 6.2 Breadth-first search

The code for the search function in 'bfs.py' comes directly from the 'Implementing the Graph' video.
Instead of just searching for a mango seller, we now want to search for more items. Your job is to
modify the code so it accepts both a name AND item. Return the person that is associated with the
item that is passed in. Test you code by running 'contactapp.py'.
