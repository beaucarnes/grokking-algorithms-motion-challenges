DO IT! CHALLENGE - 7.3 Dijkstra's Algorithm

You are trying to find the fastest route from one friend's house to another friend's house. On the way,
you want to visit other friends. This is a great problem for Dijkstra's algorithm! For this challenge,
you will be modifying the implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm from the video. Just as
in the video, the goal is to determine the quickest path from one node on the graph to another node on
the graph. However, now both the start and end nodes are set by the user. Instead of just going
one direction on the graph, each node is connected in both directions. You must change the 'find_shortest'
function so it returns the correct total cost to get from the start to end node. Also, you must complete the
'fill_costs_and_parents' function so it initialized the costs and parents dictionaries correctly.
